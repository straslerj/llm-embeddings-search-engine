To initiate the final project, you and your team will be  Final Project (Group)   For the final project, your task is to tackle a real -world problem of your choosing using authentic datasets. To  maintain project momentum, each team will be required to demo initial progress to the instructor by implementing a baseline model. The subsequent phase involves enhancing the baseline model and conducting  comparisons with alternative algorithms. The culmination of the project will be an in- class presentation by each  team during the 16th week of the course.   Grading Scale   Grades are determined by cumulative average point total as follows:    Letter  Range   A 93% +   AB 89-92.9%   B 85-89.9%  BC 81-84.9%  C 77-80.9%   CD 74-76.9%  of knowledge in machine learning.  Final Project Initial Proposal  (Group)   The final project is an integral component of this course. To initiate the final project, you and your team will be  required to submit a project proposal comprising three potential topics of interest. In this proposal, you will also describe the datasets you intend to utilize along with their sources. The instructor will then review and approve one of the topics, giving preference to your primary choice, while also ensuring there are no duplications  among the selected topics for the final projects across the class.

COURSE POLICIES   Late Assignment Policy  It is very important that work be turned in on time or you will find it very difficult to catch up. All work in the course  (e.g., projects, papers, exams, quizzes, etc.) will be due by 11:59 pm ET on the date noted on the class calendar.   Any assignment submitted after the due date will have 10% deducted from points earned for each day that it is late. Students should reach out to their instructor immediately to discuss any concerns.   Faculty Communication and Feedback   At the beginning of the  course, make sure that you understand the instructor’s preferred mode of communication  of this course—we will operate under a consistent time structure for posting assignments and responding to online discussions.   Submitting Assignments  You will submit all other types of individually written assignments to the appropriate assignment dropbox.   Unless otherwise noted, assignments will be due by 11:59 p.m. ET on the date noted on the class calendar.
