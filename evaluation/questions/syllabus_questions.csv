"Tell me about the final project","For the final project, your task is to tackle a real-world problem of your choosing using authentic datasets. To maintain project momentum, each team will be required to demo initial progress to the instructor by implementing a baseline model. The subsequent phase involves enhancing the baseline model and conducting comparisons with alternative algorithms. The culmination of the project will be an in-class presentation by each team during the 16th week of the course"
